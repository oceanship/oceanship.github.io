Hello, Everybody.

Pending the reestablishment of contact with the world of [Patchwack](http://www.oceanshipgames.com/articles/patchwack/) – about which more later – we have decided to launch Whistly Bird, a Flappy Bird clone that makes you whistle to flap.

Considering that Dong Nguyen made Flappy Bird in a few hours, there shouldn’t be too much to say about the “development” of Whistly Bird. 

But the bird went through several iterations. As you can see, we were aiming at one point for the ugliest bird possible:

Shouts were also heard of: “WHERE’S THE BEAK? WHERE’S THE BEAK?”

In addition, some of us also felt that we should give Whistly Bird an existential twist: make the bird avoid its own image being reflected in the obstacle-pillars (sort of like a comment on narcissism). Here’s an early concept with pillars that look like candy canes:

The original idea for this game (an oxymoron if I ever heard one) appeared when we were brainstorming a spaceship adventure game (for mobile phone) in which you play someone waking up from suspended animation. We thought that the first thing you should do upon awakening was wake up your shipmates – by shouting “WAKE UP! WAKE UP!” into the phone.

Then somebody said: “Imagine Flappy Bird where you had to shout into the phone.”

And so Whistly Bird was born.
