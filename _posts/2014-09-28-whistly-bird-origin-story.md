Bogie first met Whistly in a jazz club in the Tenderloin.

Whistly wanted to jam that night, but there wasn’t much call for a jazz bird.

Bogie was on the rebound, but he wasn’t looking for love -- just the bottom of a glass.

He took Whistly home that night, and Whistly became his eyes and ears.

It turned out that Whistly was too noisy for a spy.

Bogie just let him hang around the house.

One day, Lauren Bacall showed up and vindicated Whistly’s existence.

Now Bogie had the girl, so he launched Whistly on his own adventure.

To the late great Bogie and Bacall: WE ARE NOT WORTHY
