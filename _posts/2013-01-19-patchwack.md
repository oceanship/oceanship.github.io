## Rathston Asylum and the Origin of Patchwack
 

### Part I


In 1841, the Massachusetts legislature chartered a corporation for the establishment of “an asylum for the moral treatment of the disruptively insane.” Shares were bought by factory owners, congressmen, state senators, churchmen, developers and financiers.

The Rathstons, a prominent Boston family, donated the land (on a bend of the Connecticut River). Finished in 1845, the Asylum was a 250-bed neo-gothic structure. It was intended as a prison for violent lunatics, as a reformatory for drunkards, and as a workhouse for misfits. The accent was placed on work. In true Protestant fashion, it was believed that idleness caused “mental disease” and that industry was the cure.

At this time, asylums were generally working farms and also produced furniture, tools, or clothes. At Rathston, they manufactured dolls.

The facility was laid out so that the manufactory was the center of the structure. It was well-lit and easily supervised.

By the standards of the time, Rathston Asylum was progressive. The “paying” residents (lunatic members of affluent families) were treated the same as indigent residents whose care was subsidized by donations and public money.

The inmates of Rathston were well-treated: cages, icewater, beatings, shackles, masks, and belts were not normally employed. This relative freedom allowed a curious behavior to develop: patients took dolls that they had made and secreted them on their persons. When unobserved, the patients would take out their dolls and play with them.

The first Director of Rathston Asylum, Dr. Isaac Hutchens, a progressive physician trained in Boston and Heidelberg and influenced by the British lunacy reform movement, was the first to notice this doll-play behavior.

Rather than remove the dolls and punish the inmates for their theft, Dr. Hutchens observed that the doll-play had a calming effect on the patients. At bedtime, patients spoke to their dolls, recounting the events of the day. They confided in their doll as if in a diary. This behavior, Dr. Hutchens noted, relaxed lunatics and made them more open and communicative the next day.

Hutchens encouraged the residents of Rathston to play with their dolls. In time, many patients improved, particularly young women diagnosed with “hysteria.” Some of these developed regular, industrious habits; Hutchens considered them reformed. Hutchens released several of these patients back to their (wealthy) families, who became ardent supporters of his hospital and his work.

But he never divulged his methods. He judged that doll-play would be considered too radical (even by progressive reformers such as Dorothea Dix). Effectively compelled into secrecy, he abandoned his youthful dream of revolutionizing medical science and focussed instead on quietly healing the inmates of Rathston Asylum.

Gradually, he won over the staff of the asylum -- and secured their discretion. The result was an institution of unparalleled equality between staff and inmates. It did not hurt that the Rathston dolls sold well, and that the manufactory was therefore profitable, and that the staff were well-paid.

Dr. Hutchens never married. He led the Asylum (later renamed the Rathston Mental Hospital) until his death at the age of 85 in 1901. By the end of his life, he was referring to his method as “doll therapy,” and closely following the emerging discipline of “psychology” in Vienna.

Every doll that stayed in Rathston Hospital had an owner, and usually several. All were conversed with and played with until they quite literally fell apart. Then they were disposed of. Some dolls were burned with the autumn leaves.

One particular doll had an unusual history. It was noticed in the manufactory by Dr. Hutchens himself, who took it and placed it in his pocket. A few minutes later, passing through the kitchen, he pulled out the doll and put it on the mantelpiece over the fireplace. Then he walked away. 

The staff believed that he must have forgotten the doll. They left it there for decoration. From time to time, a passing patient would see it and reach out to take it. “No,” he or she was told, “That one is just for looking.” And so the doll remained there and became a kind of mascot. Fire singed its legs and smoke blackened its face. But the environment dessicated and preserved it.

When Dr. Hutchens died, his loyal staff concealed his death for many years. One orderly who resembled the late Director dressed like the doctor and walked back and forth in front of the windows. Rare visitors to the Hospital grounds left convinced that the doctor still lived.

At last, in 1917, the secret of Rathston Hospital was divulged. Visiting professional psychiatrists were shocked. In addition to the omnipresent carrying of dolls and constant egalitarian play involving both patients and staff, male and female patients were not segregated, and topics such as masturbation and menstruation were openly discussed. The place, one psychiatrist wrote, “resembled a free-love transcendentalist community more than a mental institution.”

But it was the dolls that were most disturbing. The dolls of Rathston had become loved in the region; almost every child had grown up with one. Now, due to the (perceived) immorality and perversion inside the workshops of Rathston, all the dolls were tainted -- and with them the childhoods of New England.

Rathston Hospital was purged. The doll workshops were closed. The dolls were destroyed. The Hospital was restructured along modern principles. By 1930, it had become a conventional Mental Hospital with liberal use of electroshock, castration, lobotomies, and other advanced therapies.

In 1940, a fire started in the kitchen at Rathston and the Hospital burned down. Several dozen patients died in a locked ward. The hospital was closed and never reopened. In 1957, the building was razed to make way for an interstate highway.
