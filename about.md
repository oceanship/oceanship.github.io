OceanShip is an independent game studio with an aging crew of three. We are currently moored near the Brussels canal district. That's in Belgium.

Development of our first project, the MMORPG Patchwack, began in 2012. It's becalmed right now though. Money is needed to commit us to this doll world of adventurous visitors, clever patients, ambitious interns, cunning directors, and crazy inventors.

Meanwhile, we have launched our problem-solving arcade game TrueCube (play 2D but think 3D), available via browser and Android. And we've developed our noisy free Flappy Bird game, WhistlyBird -- again for Android and desktop.

Contact us (staff@patchwack.com) if you want to help out. We are open to anything that will speed our voyages, as we seek out new games that no one has seen before. (So why a Flappy Bird clone? We just felt like it.)
